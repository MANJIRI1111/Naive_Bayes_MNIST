# Naive_Bayes_MNIST
Key Insights:
1. Used Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib to do data analysis and visualization.
2. Performed initial data cleaning and pre-processing on MNIST Dataset.
3. Implemented scaling diving by 255, so the pixel intensity is normalized to value  between 0 and 1 to enhance model performance and improve model accuracy
4. Built 3 Classification models Naive Bayes classifier, and Non-Na√Øve Bayes Classifier and  K Nearest Neighbour Classifier
5. Got the best accuracy for KNN model i.e. 96.91%.
6. Generated Confusion Matrix to visualize the results.

Summary on Use Case:

The proposed digit recognition system for Insurance companies  like Experian addresses the challenge of processing large volumes of handwritten documents by automating data capture, particularly for insurance claims and account forms. Leveraging a machine learning model trained on the MNIST dataset, this solution enhances efficiency by digitizing handwritten fields such as account and policy numbers, improving accuracy and reducing operational costs. Implemented within a document scanning pipeline, the model achieves high accuracy, especially with K-Nearest Neighbors (96.91%), and is effective at recognizing diverse handwriting styles. Continuous monitoring and fine-tuning ensure optimal performance, enabling Experian to drive cost savings, improve customer satisfaction, and align with digital transformation goals.
